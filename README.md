# TASK 1: Installing the required programmes for this internship, such as Ubuntu on VMBox, Visual C++, and writing an example of C code along with evaluating RISC assembly code for the sample C code, are the tasks at hand.


## Step 1: Setting Up Ubuntu within VMBox

1. Install Ubuntu on VMBox.
2. Launch Ubuntu's terminal.

## Step 2: Install Leafpad

```bash
$ sudo apt install leafpad
```
Navigate to the home directory:
```
$ cd
```
```
$ leafpad filename.c &
```

## Step 3: Compile and Run the C Code
Compile the C code:

```

$ gcc filename.c

```
Run the compiled program:
```
$ ./a.out
```

## Step 4: Compile C Code with RISC-V Compiler
Compile the C code using the RISC-V compiler:

```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o filename.o filename.c
```
List the compiled object file:

```
$ ls -ltr filename.o
```

## Step 5: Display Assembly Code

Compile the C code with optimization flags:

```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o filename.o filename.c
```
Display the optimized assembly code for the main function:

```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d filename.o | less /main
```
