## Code Overview

```cpp
const int numReadings = 35;
int readings[numReadings];
int readIndex = 0;
int total = 0;
int average = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  for (int thisReading = 0; thisReading < numReadings; thisReading++) {
    readings[thisReading] = 0;
  }
}

void loop() {
  total = total - readings[readIndex];
  readings[readIndex] = analogRead(A1);
  Serial.print(readings[readIndex]);
  Serial.print(",");
  total = total + readings[readIndex];
  readIndex = readIndex + 1;

  if (readIndex >= numReadings) {
    readIndex = 0;
  }

  average = total / numReadings;
  Serial.println(average);
  delay(15);
}

```

## Explanation

### Variables

- **`const int numReadings = 35;`**  
  This constant defines the number of readings we will average. A higher number results in a smoother output but can also introduce a slight lag.

- **`int readings[numReadings];`**  
  This array stores the last 35 sensor readings.

- **`int readIndex = 0;`**  
  `readIndex` keeps track of where the current reading will be stored in the array.

- **`int total = 0;`**  
  `total` holds the sum of all the readings, which is used to calculate the average.

- **`int average = 0;`**  
  This variable stores the calculated average value.

### `setup()` Function

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  for (int thisReading = 0; thisReading < numReadings; thisReading++) {
    readings[thisReading] = 0;
  }
}
```

- **`Serial.begin(115200);`**  
  Initializes the serial communication at a baud rate of 115200, allowing us to monitor the output in the Serial Monitor.

- **Initialization Loop:**  
  The `for` loop initializes the `readings` array to zero, ensuring that we start with a clean slate before taking any sensor readings.

### `loop()` Function

```cpp
void loop() {
  total = total - readings[readIndex];
  readings[readIndex] = analogRead(A1);
  Serial.print(readings[readIndex]);
  Serial.print(",");
  total = total + readings[readIndex];
  readIndex = readIndex + 1;

  if (readIndex >= numReadings) {
    readIndex = 0;
  }

  average = total / numReadings;
  Serial.println(average);
  delay(15);
}
```

- **Subtract Old Reading:**  
  The old reading at `readIndex` is subtracted from the total to remove its effect on the average.

- **New Reading:**  
  A new analog reading is taken from pin `A1` and stored in the `readings` array at the current `readIndex`.

- **Print Reading:**  
  The new reading is printed to the Serial Monitor.

- **Update Total:**  
  The new reading is added to the total, updating the sum for the average calculation.

- **Increment Index:**  
  `readIndex` is incremented to move to the next position in the array. If `readIndex` exceeds the array size, it wraps around to zero.

- **Calculate Average:**  
  The average is calculated by dividing the `total` by `numReadings`. This smoothed value is printed to the Serial Monitor.

- **Delay:**  
  A short delay of 15 milliseconds is added to control the speed of the loop.

## Advantages of the Moving Average Filter

1. **Noise Reduction:**  
   The filter reduces random noise by averaging multiple readings, resulting in a more stable output.

2. **Simplicity:**  
   It's easy to implement and understand, making it a great choice for beginners and quick projects.

3. **Real-Time Smoothing:**  
   Provides real-time smoothing with minimal computational overhead, which is ideal for embedded systems like VSD Squadron MINI.

4. **Improved Accuracy:**  
   The filter enhances the accuracy of sensor readings, which is crucial for applications like environmental monitoring, robotics, and more.

To provide a clear pinout for the code that reads analog data from a sensor and calculates a moving average, hereâ€™s the information you would include:

### **Pinout for Moving Average Filter Code with Current Sensor**

#### **VSD Squadron Mini Connections:**

- **A1 (Analog Input Pin):**
  - **Connected to:** Output of the current sensor.
  - **Function:** Reads the analog voltage corresponding to the current measurement from the sensor.

- **GND (Ground Pin):**
  - **Connected to:** Ground pin of the current sensor.
  - **Function:** Provides a common ground reference between the Arduino and the sensor.

- **VCC (Power Pin, typically 5V or 3.3V depending on the sensor):**
  - **Connected to:** Power supply pin of the current sensor.
  - **Function:** Supplies power to the sensor.

#### **Serial Monitor:**
- **Used for:** Viewing the raw sensor data and the moving average value in real-time.


- **Current Sensor:** Connect the sensor's output to A1, ground to GND, and VCC to the appropriate power pin on the Arduino.
  

To see the code in action:

1. Connect a sensor to analog pin `A1` on your VSD Squadron MINI.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino.
3. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
4. Observe the raw sensor readings and the smoothed average values.

## Further Exploration

You can experiment with the code by changing the value of `numReadings` to see how it affects the filter's smoothness. A higher number of readings will result in a smoother output but may also introduce a slight lag in the response.
